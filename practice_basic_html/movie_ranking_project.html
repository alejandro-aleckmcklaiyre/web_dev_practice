<h1>The Best Movie (so far...)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix (1999) | Sci-Fi, Action</h3>
<h4>Directed by The Wachowskis</h4>
<p>
  The action scenes are super cool, especially the slow-motion bullet-dodging
  moments. But it’s not just about fighting; the movie also makes you think
  about reality and free will.
</p>
<p>
  Why watch? If you like action, cool effects, and movies that make you question
  everything, this one’s for you.
</p>

<h3>Enola Holmes (2020) | Mystery, Adventure</h3>
<h4>Directed by Harry Bradbeer</h4>
<p>
  The story follows her as she tries to solve a mystery while also dealing with
  people who think girls shouldn’t be detectives. Millie Bobby Brown does an
  amazing job, and the way she talks directly to the camera makes it feel like
  you’re part of the adventure.
</p>
<p>
  Why watch? It’s a fun, lighthearted mystery with a great lead character and
  some good laughs along the way.
</p>

<h3>Spirited Away (2001) | Fantasy, Adventure</h3>
<h4>Directed by Hayao Miyazaki</h4>
<p>
  This is one of the best animated movies ever! It’s about a girl named Chihiro
  who accidentally enters a magical world filled with spirits, strange
  creatures, and a creepy bathhouse run by a powerful witch. She has to work
  hard, be brave, and find a way to save her parents, who got turned into pigs
  (yep, that happens). The animation is stunning, and the story feels like a
  dream—mysterious, beautiful, and sometimes a little scary.
</p>
<p>
  Why watch? If you love unique animation, fantasy worlds, and a story that
  feels magical yet meaningful, this is a must-watch.
